Description
---

The game starts with you in front of the shrine in the center of your screen.

Enemies start coming at your shrine, trying to attack it!  If they kill it, you lose the game.

You can summons minions using juju juice to fight off the scary beasts.

The scary beasts also attack you!  If they kill you, you enter the Juju realm.

While in the Juju realm, your soul floats freely in the air.  It gradually gets sucked into your body, limiting your movement.

After a time period, your soul enters your body again and you are resurrected!

All units drop juju juice when they die.  Juju juice is a purple goopy mass that floats around in the air.

You can only collect juju juice when you are in the juju realm.

You use juju juice to summon minions, and you also use juju juice to purchase upgrades at the shrine (upgrades optional).

"Discussion"

You gotta die sometimes to get juju juice so you can summon more shit.

But it's risky cuz while you're dead you risk having your juju shrine taking damage.

Part of the interesting decision making is choosing when to die, and optimizing your juju juice collection path (designed so you won't be able to get all juju juice).

Another interesting decision making is budgeting your juju juice between upgrades and units (and what type of upgrades and what types of units).

Muju doesn't really do anything, he's just this super old guy limping around that throws his arms up in the air dramatically every once in a while to summon some shit.

The upgrades will be very minimal and simple, because fucking upgrades.
